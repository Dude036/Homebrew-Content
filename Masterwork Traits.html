      Masterwork Traits
    </h1>
    <p>
      Here is a comprehensive list of all Masterwork Traits available from this Generator. When picking Masterwork Traits, there are a few rules to consider;
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mundane weapons and armor cannot have masterwork traits attached to them. You must make the weapon/armor masterwork first.
      </li>
      <li>
        When adding a trait to a weapon or armor, the item must meet the prerequisite.
      </li>
      <li>
        The total number of masterwork traits added up cannot exceed the total Masterwork Quality. i.e. If your item is a +2 item, you may have two +1 traits or one +2 trait.
      </li>
      <li>
        A weapon cannot exceed a +10 in Masterwork Quality.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Here are the costs of Upgrading a Weapon to Masterwork or adding a Masterwork Trait.

      For example, adding Adaptive to a bow will cost a total of 4,000 GP. +1 costs 2,000 GP, and Adaptive costs 2,000 GP. When upgrading an item which is already Masterwork, it costs the amount listed, minus the current masterwork cost. For example, upgrading our Adaptive Bow to +5 would cost 48,000. +5 costs 50,000 GP minus +2 which costs 2,000 GP.

            This weapon drains Spellcasters. On a successful attack against a Spellcaster, you automatically learn what spells the caster has active. On a critical hit against a Spellcaster, you can attempt to steal a spell slot from them. Enumerate the spell slots and roll approriately to steal. Example: the Enemy has 3 level one spell slots, and 2 level two spell slots. Since there are 5 potential slots to steal, you will roll 1d10. On a 1 or 2, you steal the first level one slot. On a 3 or 4, you steal the second level one slot, and so on. On a 7 or 8, steal the first level two spell slot. On a 9 or 10 steal the second level two spell slot. Leave this to the DM's discretion. The wielder then gains that spell slot, and can use it before they take a long rest.

            This weapon leeches knowledge from Spellcasters. On a successful hit, the wielder may learn a random spell, not a cantrip, from the enemy's spellbook, even if the spell is not available to the wielder normally. If the wielder is a Wizard or Artificer, they may choose to add it to their spell book before they take a long rest to learn the spell permenantly. If the wielder is any other Spellcaster, they may choose to swap out one of their known spells for the one they learned.
