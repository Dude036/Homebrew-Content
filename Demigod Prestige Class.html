  <h1>
    Prestige Classes
  </h1>
  <p>
    Prestige classes are classes you get upon meeting a certain prerequisite. You can only take one Prestige class per character, and cannot change it except by extraordinary circumstances. You gain one level in your Prestige class for every two levels in your normal classes. For example, a 5th level fighter, has 2 levels in their Prestige class. A multiclassed 5th level fighter & 3rd level sorcerer, has 4 levels in their Prestige class. Below are potential Prestige classes.
