          Every magus contains a pool of magical energy within themselves. You can tap into this pool of power to enhance your abilities, to enchant weaponry or armor, and to shield yourself from magical effects. Your Arcane Pool pool is equal to half your level + your Intelligence modifier.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Enchant:</b> As a free action, use 1 point from your Arcane Pool to enchant your weapon to become a +1 weapon. If your weapon is already enchanted to be +1 or greater, this property is added to it as well. i.e. a +2 weapon, that is enchanted via your Arcane pool points, becomes a +3 weapon.

          You have become a student of arcane magic. Your lifeline to magic is in your spellbook. At first level, your spellbook contains a number of spells equal to your magus level + your Intelligence modifier. At each level up, you gain an additional spell that is on the Wizards' spell list.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your Spellbook is not a stagnant thing. It is ever changing. You may add spells to your spell book by copying them down into your spellbook. This process take 2 hours and 50 gold per spell level. You can then choose to prepare this spell as you would any other spell that you know. You are also able to copy down any spell from a spell scroll using this method. In order to do so, the spell must also be on the Wizard spell list.

All spells that you imbue into your weapon have their range reduced to touch, unless the spell has a range of self. If the spell has an area of effect and allows for a save, you have advantage on that save.

        <p>
          If you are unable to trigger your spells effect on the turn it was cast, at the start of your next turn, you can use your bonus action to attempt to maintain concentration on the spell. The DC for maintaining concentraition is equal to 10 + the spell's level.
