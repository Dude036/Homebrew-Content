          </h3>
        </a>
        <p>
          <span class="bold">Gun Usage:</span> All guns in Thunia tend to operate on the basic mechanics of load a round, fire a round, eject casing and other debris, repeat. If any event in that process fails, the gun misfires. When making an Attack Roll, if the d20 lands on a 1 or a 2, the gun Misfires. If the gun is in perfect condition, it gains the broken condition. If the gun has the broken condition, the gun explodes. All creatures in a 10ft radius of the gunslinger, including the gunslinger, must roll a DC15 DEX save or take the gun's regular damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are ways your misfire chance can increase, such as using poorly made bullets, which means if your misfire chance is a 4, then when making an attack roll, a 4 or lower on the die, will cause a misfire.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="bold">Ammo:</span> All ammunition is not created equal. Ammunition made for a pistol will not work for any other type of firearm. If a firearm is loaded and discharged with the incorrect ammunition, the weapon automatically misfires.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="bold">Reloading:</span> All weapons have a magazine capacity, or how many times you can pull the trigger before you're out of ammunition in the weapon. Reloading, unless otherwise stated, takes a bonus action.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="bold">Repairs & Cleanings:</span> A gunslinger needs to know their tools inside and out. With weapons only recently emerging in Thunia, having this knowledge is critical to a gunslinger's survival. During a short or long rest, you can repair your firearm back to it's original glory, with the aid of a set of Tinker's Tools. This cleaing and repair removes the broken condition as well as any effect that effect the efficacy of your firearm.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="bold">Ranges:</span> Firearms have two ranges. The first is your <u>Close Range</u>. This is the range at which you are most effective at hitting targets. Anything past that is the <u>Effective Range</u>. This is the range that you are still capable of hitting within, but it is much harder. When firing at a target outside of your effective range, roll with disadvantage.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="bold">Gun Types:</span> There are three main types of guns. For the purposes of defining the use case of these weapons, I will use the following metric;
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Pistols:</span> One Handed, Low to High Caliber Slug Round

          <li>
            <span class="bold">Rifles:</span> Two Handed, Low Caliber Slug Round

            <span class="bold">Snipers:</span> Two Handed, High Caliber Slug Round

            Muntions Creation
          </h3>
        </a>
        <p>
          Since your ammunition is rare, and often difficult to come by, you need to be able to make your own. This isn't helped by the fact that once a Munition is discharged, it cannot be recovered after combat. With the aid of your Tinker's tools, and enough raw materials, you can create your own ammunition. You can create up to Gunslinger Level + Intelligence modifier rounds per hour of rest, with a minimum of 1 per hour.

Your attachment can be swapped out during a short or long rest. Each item can either be crafted or purchased from a town, but that item is strictly meant for the weapon it was designed for.

              If you ever are being chased, or really want to ruin someone's day, use this. This explosive works in two parts. When the charge makes contact with the ground, or a creature, the cannister fills the area with heavily obscuring Fog. This fog lasts for 1 minute, or until a wind of at least 10 MPH disperses it. A creature attempting to look through the Fog, or a creature inside of the fog attempting to look out, automatically fails any ability check that requires sight. Also, any attacks made against someone in the Fog have disadvantage.
            </P>
            <p>
              On the following round, the cannister becomes electricifed, and the smoke carries that electricity to all enemies inside the area of effect. All creatures still within the Fog, need to make a Dexterity Saving Throw. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage.

            <p>
              <span class="bold">Special: </span> The Electric Smoke cannot be planted, or remotely detonated. It must be thrown to go off.

              Flashbangs are not intended to deal damage or cause any major harm. They are meant to disorient and stun targets. When thrown or placed, the item creates a loud explosive and a brilliant white flash. Hence the name, Flashbang.

              More of a trap, than a conventional bomb, but what does it matter if it takes out an enemy. This bomb sits on a hairpin trigger. If anyone walks within 5 ft of it's location, it will trigger. In combat, any creature within 5 ft of the target of this bomb makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a successful saving throw, they take half damage. Out of combat, a successful Stealth check against your Save DC doesn't trigger this bomb.

          Firearms are an immense leap forward in Technology. As such, incorporating them into your games can bring a lot of scrutiny as to their function, creation, and features. This section attempts to explain their creation and general function. I leave the features and facets to your imagination.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following is the creation process of a firearm from start to finish. All steps can be done completely seperate. Your Gun can be disassembled and rebuilt as part of the clean procedure, so you're free to rebuild your Gun as you see fit.

          Casting is the process of forging material and placing the molten material into a cast, which is then used to create the barrel. This part needs to be the most hardy of the firearm, as it's the piece that needs to withstand the most abuse, and remain true. There are several different types of materials that can be used to create a Barrel, each with different properties.
        </p>
        <p>
          When crafting a Barrel, you'll need an active forge for a few hours. To begin creating a barrel, choose your material, spend the requisite time building the barrel, and finally roll on the success table. At the end of this process, you have a part that's worthy of being attached to a gun.

          You can create a stock from the two major materials. Woods and Metals. Wood offers a softer Stock, and more suitable for extended use. It's also something you that's easier to create while in the wild. Metals, on the other hand, offer a more rigid experience, and thus are more effective with weapons that are fired continuously. Metal is also more durable, and less likely to break upon impact.

          When creating a Stock, you follow a similar pattern to creating a barrel. Choose a Material, Spend the needed time, then roll on the success table.

          This is the stage where you decide which type of Ammo is going to be used, and which the gun will be capable of firing. There are a few things to note when deciding Ammo, you are not restricting the type of firearm you can make. A pistol cannot fire a Long Distance Sniper round. This process also dictates how much metal is required to craft a bullet for your weapon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since this step is a decision, and not based on your crafting capability, there's no rolling associated with this step. You simply choose the Loading Mechanism and the Bullet Caliber that's right for you, and spend the time necessary to build the Casing and Magazine.

        <p>
          As with previous steps, begin with collecting the necessary materials, spend the requisite time building, and finally roll on the Success table.
