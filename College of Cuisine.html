        At 3rd Level, you've always got food on hand. So long as you've prepared enough food, you can give a meal to someone as a bonus action. Then can consume the snack as a reaction and gain an additional 1d4 to any roll during their following turn. You can make as many snacks as you have time to prep. A snack takes 1 minute to make, and costs 1 gp. The snack loses its effects after 24 hours, or until you take a long rest.
