  <h1>
    Prestige Classes
  </h1>
  <p>
    Prestige classes are classes you get upon meeting a certain prerequisite. You can only take one Prestige class per character, and cannot change it except by extraordinary circumstances. You gain one level in your Prestige class for every two levels in your normal classes. For example, a 5th level fighter, has 2 levels in their Prestige class. A multiclassed 5th level fighter & 3rd level sorcerer, has 4 levels in their Prestige class.

            Bloodthirst
          </h3>
        </a>
        <p>
          Bloodthirst is a natural response that Lycanthropes have to death and the full moon. As the Full Moon rises or your HP approaches your Bloodthirst threshold, you become more and more Feral until you finally transform. Transforming is not a easy process, and most certainly not pleasant. When you transform, your bones crack and shift, your body contorts in unnatural ways, and your face shapes into your Lycan Heritage. You forget all your Learned abilities, i.e. your class abilities, because of the Feral nature you have now become.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your Natural Attacks increase in damage, and you can make additional Attacks during the same attack action as you level up.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you undertake your Transformation by reaching your Bloodthirst Threshhold, the process takes 1 round, and only movement and reactions can be taking while transforming. You cannot retain any mental prowess when you reach your Bloodthirsty Threshhold. You drop all weapons and begin attacking the nearest enemy. You will continue attacking until there are no enemies or you drop to 0 HP.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you undertake your Transformation by the rising of the full moon, the process takes 1 minute, and you cannot take actions or reactions while transforming. At the end of your transformation, roll a Constitution Saving Throw. the DC is equal to 10 + Lycan Level. On a fail, you enter bloodthirst regularly. On a success, you retain all your Class abilities and gain your Bloodthirst abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once your HP reaches 0, you leave your Bloodthirsty state, and gain 1 level of exhaustion (up to 5). You cannot die by simply leaving your Bloodthirst. If you are healed below your Bloodthirst Threshhold, you do not enter a bloodthirst again. However, if you are healed above your Bloodthirst Threshhold, and drop back down, you enter this state again. You also leave your Bloodthrist once there are only Allies within sight.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are not affected by Exhaustion while in your Bloodthirsty state, and therefore do not take any of the negative effects during your bloodthirst.
        </p>
        <p>
          * Note: Bloodthirst removes all of your cognitive functions, <u>unless</u> you are an offspring of two Lycanthropes. If this is the case, when you become Bloodthirsty, roll a DC15 Constitution Saving throw to maintain your Learned abilities.

        <p>
          You've not only grown acustomed to the night, you've embraced it. Once per day, as a standard action, you can make a single Bite attack on a creature. If the attack succeeds to hit, the creature must make a save against your Vampiric Curse. On a failed save, the creature immediatly becomes your Fledgling. You can command it as if it were a child, and the creature must obey.
        </p>
        <p>
          This version of the Curse is unstable. If you give a command that goes in direct opposition to the creature's nature, they can make another saving throw against the Curse. If the curse is freed by this method, the creature has 10 days before becoming a vampire. If the creature is not freed from the curse, and you attempt to assert your control normally, the creature has disavantage on the save.
